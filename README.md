# 🎙️ AI Generated Voice Detection API

> Detect whether a voice is **Human** or **AI Generated** across 5 Indian languages using acoustic signal analysis.

---

## 🌍 Supported Languages

* Tamil
* English
* Hindi
* Malayalam
* Telugu

---

## 🧠 What This Project Does

This project provides a secure REST API that accepts a Base64 encoded MP3 audio and determines whether the voice was spoken by a real human or generated by an AI system.

The detection is performed using **speech signal processing heuristics** such as:

* Pitch stability
* Spectral smoothness
* Energy consistency
* Temporal variation

AI generated voices typically show **unnaturally stable acoustic patterns**, while human voices exhibit natural irregularities.

## 🔐 Authentication

All requests must include an API key in headers:

```
x-api-key: sk_test_123456789
```

Requests without a valid API key will be rejected.

## 🧪 Testing via cURL

```
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/voice-detection \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -H "x-api-key: sk_test_123456789" \\
  -d '{
    "language": "English",
    "audioFormat": "mp3",
    "audioBase64": "BASE64_STRING"
  }'
```

## 🧪 How Detection Works (High Level)

The system analyzes acoustic features rather than words, making it language independent.

Human speech:

* Natural pitch variation
* Micro pauses and breathing noise
* Irregular spectral distribution

AI speech:

* Overly consistent pitch
* Extremely clean waveform
* Stable frequency distribution

This makes the model effective across multiple languages without translation.

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria Targeted

* Accuracy of detection
* Consistency across languages
* Secure API design
* Reliable JSON responses
* Clear explanation output

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Very short audio (<0.5s) may reduce confidence
* Extremely noisy recordings may affect accuracy
* Not designed for music detection
